# 📊 Portfolio Analytics Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Google Analytics to track visitors to your portfolio.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your portfolio now includes:
- **Real-time view tracking** (demo using localStorage)
- **Google Analytics integration** (requires setup)
- **Terminal commands** to check stats: `analytics`, `stats`, `visitors`

## 🔧 Setting Up Google Analytics (Real Analytics)

### Step 1: Create Google Analytics Account
1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Start measuring"
4. Create an account name (e.g., "Mohammad Portfolio")

### Step 2: Set Up Property
1. Enter property name: "Mohammad Abbass Portfolio"
2. Select your country and currency
3. Choose "Web" as the platform
4. Enter your website URL (e.g., `https://your-portfolio-domain.com`)
5. Click "Create Stream"

### Step 3: Get Your Tracking ID
1. After creating the stream, you'll see a **Measurement ID** (starts with `G-`)
2. Copy this ID (e.g., `G-ABC123DEF456`)

### Step 4: Configure Your Portfolio
1. Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env
```

2. Add your Measurement ID to the `.env` file:
```bash
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-YOUR-ACTUAL-ID-HERE
```

3. Replace `G-YOUR-ACTUAL-ID-HERE` with your actual Measurement ID

### Step 5: Deploy with Analytics
1. Rebuild your portfolio:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

3. Make sure to add the environment variable on your hosting platform too!
